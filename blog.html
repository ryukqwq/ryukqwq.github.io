      <p>This entry marks the first day of my blog!</p>
      <p>The aim of this blog is to create a space where I can write freely
        about anything and everything. I believe retrospection and self-understanding
        are pivotal aspects of growth regardless of one's career choice or future plans.
        In this respect, I want to document my experiences, thoughts, and life
        in a manner that I can look back on to decipher, which isn't a new practice for me!</p>
      <p>I've been publishing YouTube videos, posting frequent Instagram posts, and
        journaling daily since 2017. These practices have always been my method of
        expression, and more importantly, a form of data collection by which
        I am able to consolidate my beliefs.</p>
      <p>I once heard an old man on the news say that the days we consider normal create
        the flow of time. The normalcy and redundancy of our life shapes us in a manner
        that is unmemorable yet the most substantial like our time prior to birth. It's the
        morning rituals of hot coffee and brain rot or school commutes blasting Spotify
        (Apple Music for losers) or cooking the same sad chicken broccoli dinner for the
        millionth time that builds the backbone by which our memories are permitted.
